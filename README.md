This repository is for practicing the GitHub Flow in Software Assurance Class
Learning how to contribute to the open source code for more secure system.
Source code vulnerability is the gateway for system exploitation.
I am in love with this profession.
Software engineering without a cybersecurity expert is a time bomb.
